Magnetic Loop antenna SPICE model

Based on ARRL handbook theory and F5RDS and AA5TB excel calculators.

Mutual inductance or couping coefficient was calculated by INCA software,
it was the same if coupling loop and main loops diameters ratio and main loop and coupling loop wire diameters ratio still the same.

TODO list:
  Efficiency
  SWR
  Voltage and current
